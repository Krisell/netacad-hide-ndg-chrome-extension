# Hide "NDG Online Lab Service" modules in Netacad for Cisco CCNA Cyber Security Operations

This project is a simple Chrome extension which automatically hides "NDG Online Lab Service" modules in Netacad when presenting the course overview for Cisco CCNA Cyber Security Operations. This is useful if you don't plan to use these modules and instead run the virtual machines on a physical device.

## How to use

1. Download the source code, `git clone` or the zip file, by clicking on the green "Code" button here at GitHub.
2. In Google Chrome, enter `chrome://extensions/` in the address bar and press enter
3. Click on the `Load unpacked` button (you might have to enable `developer mode` first), and locate the folder where the project was saved.

4. This will add and enable the extension, and the NDG modules should now be hidden.

5. If you click on the extension to the right of the address bar, you see a simple UI where you can toggle the hiding. Note that the default state is always to hide the modules when nagivating to the page, as long as the extension is enabled.
